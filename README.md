This project helps to analyse and predict the price of a food based on the given data.

`Zomato Insight.ipynb` files contain all data analysis i found on Zomato dataset. At the end of the file I saved a model using **Pickle**.

Then I loaded the model in **Flask**. So users can input values and predict the price of the food.

I also **dockerized** the project so that you can run in one click on any of your device.
